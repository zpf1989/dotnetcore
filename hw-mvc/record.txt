Middleware：
    In ASP.NET Core you compose your request pipeline using Middleware.
    Middleware is software that is assembled into an application pipeline to handle requests and responses

    Each component chooses whether to pass the request on to the next component in the pipeline, 
        and can perform certain actions before and after the next component is invoked in the pipeline. 
        Request delegates are used to build the request pipeline. The request delegates handle each HTTP request

    表现形式：
        1、动态方法（called in-line middleware）
        2、定义在一个可重用的类中
     A delegate can also decide to not pass a request to the next delegate, which is called short-circuiting the request pipeline. 
        Short-circuiting is often desirable because it allows unnecessary work to be avoided；
        Exception-handling delegates need to be called early in the pipeline, so they can catch exceptions that occur in later stages of the pipeline
    Changes to HttpResponse after the response has started will throw an exception. 
        For example, changes such as setting headers, status code, etc, will throw an exception
        HttpResponse.HasStarted is a useful hint to indicate if headers have been sent and/or the body has been written to.

Servers：
    ASP.NET Core 宿主不直接监听请求，而是依赖于一个HTTP服务器实现将请求映射到web应用

Configuration：
    ASP.NET Core uses a new configuration model for handling simple name-value pairs,
    it pulls from an ordered set of configuration providers;
    The built-in configuration providers support a variety of file formats (XML, JSON, INI) 
    and environment variables to enable environment-based configuration
